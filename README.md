Ideas to work on 

Finally, am in a position to begin working on a new side-project. 
I intend to start a project based in the use of  a rasberry-pi and python programming. 
As a student, I work a University with potentially plenty of resources to borrow. Things that I might be able to use include: Arduino, Breadboards, 3D printers, soldering equipment, and much more. 

 
 Ideas I'm considering: 
 1. Smart Mirror for weather/schedule display
 2. Automated Cat-feeder, for my cat: Apollo. 
 3. real-time data display
 4. small-scale energy storage system
